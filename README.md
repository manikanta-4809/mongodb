### Explanation

I created a database in MongoDB Compass, assigned a database name, and created a collection. I then inserted 10 documents into the collection. For all 10 documents, I set the inprogress field to false and the done field to true. Next, I added a new document (the 11th entry) with the inprogress field set to false by default. Using the newly created documentâ€™s _id, I updated its inprogress field to true. After that, I added new_date and created_at fields to all 11 documents. I then retrieved all documents using the find command. Additionally, I set a deadline field for all 11 documents. I used the countDocuments command to count the total number of documents in the collection. Finally, I queried for documents where the done field was updated within the last 7 minutes and retrieved the timestamp for a specific document.
