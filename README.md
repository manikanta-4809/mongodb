### Explanation

I have created a databse in mongodb compass and after that assining database name and collection name.Then after creating a database i have added 10 entries and after that i made all the like inprogress as flase and done as true and then after making all the entries as false and after that adding a new entries and default make it flase and after that change the new entry boolean as true using that new created object id and it will modify as true .After doing all this add new_date and created
_at and then find all the entries using the find command and then i have set deadline for all the 11 entries and i found the count of the documents using countDocument command and again finding all the updates that done before 7 mins using that tinme finding command and finded time for the specific document.
